2.[keep it for now]  muxes module: redundant mux definition?
3.[done] instruction memory Size: 24 entries then the address needs only 5 bits, not 11 ..16 entries (address 4bits) MODIFIED 
4. [done] instruction memory initialization ?? ..need some way to setup the array with some values at testbench (maybe add a write option and do it once)
5. visit the control unit to reflect jmp/bnq/beq changes discussed today (11/23)
