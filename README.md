## Description
This repository contains the design and implementation of a CPU using SystemVerilog, along with a small memory module. The CPU is capable of executing a set of instructions inspired by the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).

## Key Features:
- Data Path and Control Unit: Comprehensive design of the CPU's data path and control logic.
- Memory System: Includes modules to store, read, and write instructions and data.
- SystemVerilog Testbench: Provides testbenches for verification and validation of the design.

## Objectives:
- Build a functional CPU capable of executing basic instructions.
- Verify the design through rigorous testing.
- Demonstrate integration between the CPU and memory modules.


## How to Use:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Explore the rtl folder for the SystemVerilog code files.
- Run the testbench scripts available in the testbench folder to verify the design.

## Future Enhancements:
- Extend support for additional instructions.
- Introducing Forwarding / pipeline.
- Optimize the memory system for larger workloads.
